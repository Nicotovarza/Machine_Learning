#This paper is about Airbnb price prediction using machine learning and sentiment analysis
To better grasp the essence of this paper, first we need to understand its research question. The preceding context revolves around the fact that on Airbnb, prices are determined by the hosts based on their own discretion, potentially leading to scenarios of overvaluation or undervaluation. Given this market issue, the question this document aims to address is: What is the optimal price for an Airbnb rental? To tackle this, it leverages property characteristics, host information, and feedback gathered within the application.
Among the strengths observed in this document is their utilization of econometric techniques, tree-based models, SVR, and neural networks that capture complex relationships. This significantly enhances the predictive capacity of the model, resulting in a better adjusted R-squared. Additionally, machine learning techniques are employed to identify relevant variables and streamline the model, thereby reducing overfitting, variance, and improving interpretation. In contrast, some weaknesses include excessive data manipulation, which could introduce selection bias. Moreover, irrelevant features might be included or there could be issues of omitted variables, leading to problems of inconsistency and bias due to endogeneity.
This research extends the methodologies discussed in previous literature by integrating neural networks and customer sentiments through sentiment analysis. Employing this data for rental price predictions represents a novel approach, adding significant value to this study. Furthermore, the SVR model with RBF Kernel emerged as the top performer, boasting the highest R-squared.
In future research, the effectiveness of various feature selection methods and the relevance of Random Forest features could be further investigated. Additionally, incorporating data from other hotel services may enhance the performance of K-means clustering with Ridge Regression modeling.
